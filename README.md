> [!WARNING]
> The `raspicam2` package is deprecated. Use [`camera_ros`](https://github.com/christianrauch/camera_ros) instead.
> The MMAL rawcam component is now considered [_legacy_](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/camera_software.html#mmal-rawcam-component). From Raspberry Pi OS 11 (bullseye) on, all Raspberry Pi cameras are interfaced via [libcamera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/bullseye-camera-system/) by default. [`camera_ros`](https://github.com/christianrauch/camera_ros) uses libcamera to interface with Raspberry Pi cameras as well as standard V4L2 cameras.
